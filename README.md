# Robot-leg

## In the design of the robot's leg, I incorporated two servo motors and two revolute joints to ensure a full range of motion and ease of movement.

### Servo Motors:

Ankle Servo Motor: Positioned at the ankle, this servo motor facilitates smooth and controlled movements of the foot, enhancing the robot's stability and maneuverability.
Hip Servo Motor: Placed at the hip, this servo motor allows the robot to move sideways, providing lateral flexibility and balance.

### Revolute Joints:

Knee Revolute Joint: Located at the knee, this joint enables the leg to bend easily, mimicking the natural bending motion of a human leg.
Hip Revolute Joint: Also at the hip, this joint allows forward movement, ensuring that the robot can walk or move in a straight line efficiently.

These components together create a versatile and flexible robotic leg capable of various movements necessary for dynamic locomotion.
